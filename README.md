 # AI Agents: Enhancing Decentralized Intelligence

## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are intelligent systems designed to perform tasks autonomously by processing real-time data and interacting with their environment. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), which are trained on vast datasets but lack real-time interactivity, AI agents can:

- Make decisions.
- Solve complex problems.
- Interact with external systems.
- Execute actions autonomously.

This versatility allows AI agents to transcend natural language processing, offering advanced capabilities in various domains, including blockchain-based applications.
