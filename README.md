# AI Agents: Enhancing Decentralized Intelligence

## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are intelligent systems designed to perform tasks autonomously by processing real-time data and interacting with their environment. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), which are trained on vast datasets but lack real-time interactivity, AI agents can:

- Make decisions.
- Solve complex problems.
- Interact with external systems.
- Execute actions autonomously.

This versatility allows AI agents to transcend natural language processing, offering advanced capabilities in various domains, including blockchain-based applications.

## What Can AI Agents Do On-Chain?

AI agents bring automation and intelligence to blockchain ecosystems, enabling decentralized systems to operate more effectively. Here are some examples of their capabilities:

1. **Boost Savings Returns:**
   - Automatically identify and allocate crypto assets to the best DeFi platforms to maximize interest or yield.

2. **Spot Easy Profits:**
   - Detect arbitrage opportunities by analyzing price differences across multiple exchanges and executing profitable trades.

3. **Check Loan Safety:**
   - Analyze on-chain data to evaluate the health of crypto loans, flagging risky ones to prevent defaults or liquidations.

4. **Sell Risky Loans:**
   - Act as a liquidator by selling a borrowerâ€™s collateral automatically if the loan repayment fails to meet safety thresholds.

5. **Predict Token Prices:**
   - Use AI models to forecast token price movements, helping users make informed buy or sell decisions.
